  "ONBOARDING.TEAM_INTRO": "A <strong>Team</strong> is how you organize your information for {botName} to access. Each <strong>Team</strong> is a unique repository that contains files, folders, and notes that {botName} can access for you on demand!",
  "ONBOARDING.TEAM_PURPOSE": "A <strong>Team</strong> can represent many different things. It could be used to organize class materials (notes, handouts, research) or represent a department (HR, Marketing, Sales) or even be a place for essential household information (finances, insurance, estate plans). The critical thing is each <strong>Team</strong> is information you find vital and you want {botName} to know.",
  "ONBOARDING.TEAM_SECURITY": "Finally, each <strong>Team</strong> you create is private, separate, and secure. That means that information in one <strong>Team</strong> is kept wholly separate from any other <strong>Team</strong> you add. Each <strong>Team</strong> is essentially a new <strong>{botName} AI</strong> you've trained to become an expert on just those materials!",
  "ONBOARDING.TEAM_DESCRIPTION": "<strong>Teams</strong> are how you organize all the information you want {botName} to be able to access. Each <strong>Team</strong> is unique and secure. <strong>Teams</strong> can represent anything you need to organize from class materials, organizational departments, key customers, or essential household information. If it's important to you and the people you live/work with, make it a <strong>Team!</strong>",

Also, you can  click <link>Teams</link> in the menu to manage the <link>Teams</link> in the application.",
  "ONBOARDING.FILES_INFO": "Click <filesLink>Files</filesLink> in the menu and you can begin building your <teamsLink>Teams</teamsLink>. I can read <strong>Word</strong> files, <strong>Excel</strong> files, <strong>Text</strong> files, <strong>Powerpoints</strong>, <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>PDFs</strong> and even those really poor quality, scanned twenty plus years ago PDFs that no one can read! Try me! You can also <strong>Add Notes</strong> which makes {appName} the perfect tool for classes and meetings!",
  "ONBOARDING.ADD_REMOVE_INFO": "You can add and remove <filesLink>Files</filesLink>, <strong>Notes</strong> and <strong>Folders</strong> from <teamsLink>Teams</teamsLink> at any time. When you remove something I <underline>immediately</underline> forget that information. When you add something it's immediately part of my memory!",
  "ONBOARDING.CHAT_INFO": "Click <chatLink>Chat</chatLink> when you want to play fetch with me! Simply enter your question into the prompt at the bottom of the screen (just like texting your best friend, which by the way, I am angling to become) and I'm off! You can rename a <chatLink>Chat</chatLink>, delete a <chatLink>Chat</chatLink>, add new <chatLink>Chats</chatLink>. It's all up to you!.",
